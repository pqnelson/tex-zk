\begin{definition}\label{prop-000W}%
Let $\varphi$ be a proposition.
We say a proposition $\psi$ is $\varphi$ in \define{Definitional Conjunctive Normal Form}
(or ``\textit{Definitional CNF}\,'' for short) if
$\psi$ is equisatisfiable as $\varphi$ (i.e., $\psi$ is satisfiable if
and only if $\varphi$ is satisfiable) and $\psi$ is obtained by finitely
many transformations, each of which introduce a ``fresh'' propositional
variable $X$ which replaces all instances of some subproposition
$\alpha$, and we conjunct onto it $X\iff\alpha$. There are a great many
variations of the procedure.
