\begin{node}[Axiomatic System]\label{prop-000F}%
Mendelson~\cite[\S1.4]{mendelson2015mathematical} offers a so-called
``axiomatic system'' for propositional logic. It's a Hilbert proof
calculus, using implication $(\implies)$ and negation $(\neg)$ as the
primitive connectives, with a handful of axioms and only
\textit{modus ponens} as its rule of inference. More importantly, this
gives us a \emph{purely syntactic notion of proof} independent of
interpretations and truth tables. We can prove that every theorem proven
by this system is a tautology, and vice-versa. In particular, Mendelson
proves the deduction theorem, the completeness theorem, and the consistency of
propositional logic.
