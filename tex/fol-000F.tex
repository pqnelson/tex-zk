\begin{definition}\label{fol-000F}%
We say a first-order formula $\varphi$ (or set of formulas) is
\define{Satisfiable} if there exists some interpretation which satisfies it.
That is, there exists an interpretation $M$ such that for all valuations
$v$ we have $\mathtt{holds}~M~v~\varphi$ evaluate to true.

The valuation plays a role only if there are free variables in $\varphi$.
