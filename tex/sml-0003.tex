We need to introduce some judgement forms if we wish to view \SML\ as
``just another deductive system''. Then we will introduce the base types
(Booleans, integers, functions, and so on). We will follow the basic
approach found in Erdmann's lecture notes~\cite{erdmann2023evaluation}.
It appears to be inspired by Harper and Stone's earlier work~\cite{harper2000:smltt-final}.
