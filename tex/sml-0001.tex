\begin{node}[Conventions]\label{sml-0001}%
We will adopt some conventions to simplify our
presentation. Specifically, we will not allow redefinitions: once a
value or function has been defined, we will not redefine
it. \SML\ allows the user to redefine functions and use static binding,
but this is too complicated.

We will also not worry about floating-point arithmetic. Although
floating-point is a critical component to numerical analysis, we will be
working with the goal of implementing proof assistants.
