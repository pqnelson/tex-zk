Set theory is the ``microcode'' to the ``machine code'' of first-order
logic that mathematics runs on. There are various different ways to
axiomatize the same intuition of a set as a ``well-defined unordered
collection without duplicates''. Underlying all these different
formalisms is \ZFC\ axioms (give or take the axiom of choice). But
\NBG\ allows for finitely axiomatizable set theory by adding minimal
support for proper classes. For more about \ZFC\ set theory,
Jech~\cite{jech2003set} remains the standard reference.
