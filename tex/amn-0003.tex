\begin{node}[Organization, IDs]\label{amn-0003}%
Finding anything is a nightmare in this approach. I have severe doubts
about this approach of ``writing the ID first, then the notes''. This
makes no sense at all. I'm following the convention that Jonathan
Sterling has outlined, that IDs should have the form
\begin{equation}
\langle\textit{identifier}\rangle ::= \langle\textit{namespace}\rangle\mbox{-}\langle\textit{number}\rangle,
\end{equation}
where the ``number'' is in base-36 and zero-padded to four places (which
means each namespace can have no more than 1,679,616 entries; adding an
extra digit allows 60,466,176 entries). Then ``namespace'' is a short
(usually 3-letter long) string like: ``amn'' (for metanotes), ``set''
(for set theory), ``fol'' (for first-order logic), etc.
