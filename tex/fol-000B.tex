\begin{node}[Remark: finite mechanization]\label{fol-000B}%
We will implement this in \SML\ using finite domains of discourse.
Pulgar\'{\i}n and Uribe-Zapata~\cite{pulgarin2023came} wrote a paper
trying to formalize a finitistic intuitionistic metatheory, which is
what Kunen~\cite{kunen2009foundations} advocates.

When $D$ is infinite (logicians allow $D$ to be uncountable), our
strategy we take in \zref{fol-0009} will fail and we cannot realize
\texttt{holds} as a \SML\ function.
