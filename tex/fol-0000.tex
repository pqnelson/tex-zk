I'm following Mendelson's treatment~\cite{mendelson2015mathematical} of
first-order logic. This is where nonlogical objects enter the
game. Unlike Mendelson, I'm not interested in philosophical word games
(``Translate into first-order logic: `Every mathematician loves
music'\,'' type questions are just inane).
