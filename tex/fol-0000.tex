I'm nonplussed with Mendelson's treatment~\cite{mendelson2015mathematical}
of first-order logic using a Hilbert system, but his treatment of
semantics (\S2.2) is adequate. I'm also borrowing heavily from the
notation used by John Harrison~\cite{harrison2009handbook} for explicit
discussion of the semantics of first-order logic. This is where nonlogical
objects enter the game. Unlike Mendelson, I'm not interested in
philosophical word games (``Translate into first-order logic: `Every
mathematician loves music'\,'' type questions are just inane).
