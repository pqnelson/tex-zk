We will define the ``dynamic semantics'' using a notion of
\define{Reduction}. Let $e$ and $e'$ be expressions. When $k$ is a
positive integer, we write $e\Reduces{k}e'$ for ``expression $e$ reduces
to $e'$ in $k$ steps.'' When we omit the $k$, writing $e\Reduces{}e'$,
we mean ``$e$ reduces to $e'$ in $0$ or more steps''.

Here ``steps'' refers to an abstract operational semantics, which we are
going to define. It may or may not be proportional to the number of CPU
cycles of an actual computer evaluating the \SML\ code.
