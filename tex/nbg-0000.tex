\begin{puzzle}
Can we formalize \NBG\ set theory using the Mizar language? Arguably, the
unique primitive notion would be a ``class'' instead of a ``set'', and
we could define ``\texttt{mode set} \verb|->| \texttt{class means ex C
  being class st it in C}''. The primitive notion ``\texttt{in}'' is a
predicate taking a mathematical object as its left argument and a class
as its right argument. We also have a primitive equality predicate.

\begin{node}[References]
There are few good references on \NBG\ set
theory. Banakh~\cite{banakh2023classical} has some lecture
notes. Someone has done some heroic work on the English wikipedia page
for \NBG\ set theory.  Pulgar\'{\i}n and
Uribe-Zapata~\cite{pulgarin2023came} wrote a paper trying to make
finitistic metatheory rigorous.

\begin{node}[NBG is about sets]
Remember, the whole point of \NBG\ set theory is to reason about sets. We
just get the ability to explicitly make statements concerning proper
classes as a side effect.
