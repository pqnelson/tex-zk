We should note that logical connectives have the following binding
strength (from weakest to strongest): $\neg$, $\land$, $\lor$,
$\implies$, $\iff$. These are ``left associative''. We may insert
parentheses to alter it. Some examples:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A\iff (\neg B)\lor C\implies D$ is parsed as $A\iff(((\neg B)\lor C)\implies D)$.
\item $A\implies B\implies C$ is parsed as $(A\implies B)\implies C$.
\end{enumerate}
