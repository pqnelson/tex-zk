We can encode the syntax of propositional logic using \SML\ as a
recursive data structure. This reflects the tree-like structure to the
grammar of well-formed formulas \zref{prop-000I}.

If we were to do this in production, we would probably place this in a
structure with the various other utility functions.

\begin{sml}
datatype Prop = Atom of string
                | Not of Prop
                | And of Prop * Prop
                | Or of Prop * Prop
                | Implies of Prop * Prop
                | Iff of Prop * Prop;
\end{sml}
\end{node}
