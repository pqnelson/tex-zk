\chapter{Type Theory}
\begin{node}\label{types-0000}%
Type theory forms one of the three main approaches to the foundations of
mathematics. It boils down to studying typed lambda calculi, usually
involving dependent types.\footnote{This is, strictly speaking, not
entirely true. Typed lambda calculi form a major vein of type theory,
and the only one that mathematicians care about. We could consider other
type theories, e.g., typed arithmetic.}
