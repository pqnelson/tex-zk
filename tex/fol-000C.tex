\begin{node}[Remark: On semantics]\label{fol-000C}%
Other foundations do not concern themselves too much with
[model theoretic] semantics. In fact, the only other family of
foundations which has a notion of models appears to be higher-order
logic (HOL). This is because Type Theory focuses on more proof theoretic
concerns.
