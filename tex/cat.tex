Depending on our choice of set theory, we have different notions of
``small'' and ``large'' collections. In \NBG\ set theory~\zref{sec:set:nbg}
``large'' collections are proper classes, and ``small'' collections are
sets. In Tarski--Grothendieck set theory~\zref{sec:set:tarski-grothendieck},
we usually pick some ``smallest'' Grothendieck universe $\mathcal{U}$
containing $\NN$, which would also contain $\RR$, $\CC$, and all other
sets we use in classical mathematics, then consider elements of
$\mathcal{U}$ as small collections. Since there's possibly more than one
choice of universe, we speak of ``$\mathcal{U}$-small'' and
``$\mathcal{U}$-large'' sets depending on if they are elements of
$\mathcal{U}$ or not. Further, subsets of $\mathcal{U}$ are sometimes
called ``$\mathcal{U}$-moderate''. For a review of the different notions
of ``small'' and ``large'' collections germane to category theory, see
Shulman~\cite{shulman2008set}.

For various constructions in Category theory, \NBG\ will prove not
enough. We could try \MK\ axioms, but it will still not be enough. Some
authors invent a notion of ``conglomerates'' for forming the collection
of all proper classes. But this will turn out to still not be enough. This
is why we turn to Tarski--Grothendieck set theory.

\begin{node}[Category]\label{cat-0001}%
\begin{definition}[Version 1]
A \define{Category} $\cat{C}$ consists of
\begin{enumerate}
\item a collection of objects $\ob(\cat{C})$;
\item for any objects $X,Y\in\ob(\cat{C})$, there is a (possibly empty)
  collection of morphisms $\hom(X,Y)$;
\item for each object $X\in\ob(\cat{C})$, an identity morphism $\id_{X}\in\hom(X,X)$;
\item for objects $X,Y,Z\in\ob(\cat{C})$ and morphisms $f\in\hom(X,Y)$,
  $g\in\hom(Y,Z)$, there exists a morphism $g\circ f\in\hom(X,Z)$
\end{enumerate}
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item composition is associative: for any $W,X,Y,Z\in\ob(\cat{C})$, if
  $f\in\hom(W,X)$, $g\in\hom(X,Y)$, $h\in\hom(Y,Z)$, then $(h\circ g)\circ f=h\circ(g\circ f)$;
\item unit laws for composition: for any objects $X,Y\in\ob(\cat{C})$,
  if $f\in\hom(X,Y)$, then $\id_{Y}\circ f=f$ and $f\circ\id_{X}=f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Version 2]\label{cat-0000}%
A \define{Category} $\cat{C}$ consists of
\begin{enumerate}
\item a collection of objects $\ob(\cat{C})$;
\item a collection of morphisms $\hom(\cat{C})$
\end{enumerate}
equipped with
\begin{enumerate}
\item a mapping $\id\colon\ob(\cat{C})\to\hom(\cat{C})$ assigning to
  each object its identity morphism;
\item a mapping $\circ\colon\hom(\cat{C})\times\hom(\cat{C})\to\hom(\cat{C})$;
\item a source and target mapping $s,t\colon\hom(\cat{C})\to\ob(\cat{C})$;
\end{enumerate}
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item source and target are respected by composition: $s(g\circ f)=s(f)$
  and $t(g\circ f)=t(g)$;
\item source and target are respected by identities: $s(\id_{X})=X$ and $t(\id_{X})=X$;
\item composition is associative: $(h\circ g)\circ f=h\circ(g\circ f)$
  whenever $t(f)=s(g)$ and $t(g)=s(h)$;
\item composition satisfies the unit laws: if $s(f)=X$ and $t(f)=Y$,
  then $\id_{Y}\circ f=f$ and $f\circ\id_{X}=f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{node}[Examples]\label{cat-0007}%
\begin{node}\label{cat-0004}%
The large category $\Set$ of sets\dots depends greatly on your choice of
foundations. ``Morally'', $\ob(\Set)$ consists of all [``small''] sets, and its
morphisms are [``small''] functions between those sets. But the exact
details varies depending on whether our foundations is predicative or
impredicative, classical or intuitionistic, admit or negate the axiom of
choice, and so on.
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-000A}%
If $\mathcal{U}$ is a Grothendieck universe~\zref{tg-0001}, then we can
form $\mathcal{U}\mbox{-}\Set$ whose collection of objects is precisely
$\mathcal{U}$ and whose collection of morphisms is precisely the
functions which are elements of $\mathcal{U}$.
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-0005}%
The large category $\cat{Ens}$ or $\cat{SET}$ is the category whose object is
the proper class of all sets $\ob(\cat{SET})=\ob(\cat{Ens})=V$ and whose
morphisms is all functions. This is a large category.
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-0003}%
The large category $\Grp$ of groups consists of $\ob(\Grp)$ the collection of all
``small'' groups [i.e., whose underlying set belongs to the universe of
sets], and the morphisms are all group morphisms.
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-0006}%
The large category $\Top$ of topological spaces consists of the collection of
all ``small'' topological spaces and morphisms are continuous maps
between them.
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-0008}%
Let $\FF$ be a field. The large category $\Vect{\FF}$ has its objects be
[``small''] vector spaces over $\FF$, and morphisms are $\FF$-linear
mappings between them.
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-000F}%
The category $\Mfld$ of $C^{\infty}$ manifolds is a category whose
objects are smooth manifolds, and morphisms are smooth mappings between
them. 
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-000M}%
Let $\cat{C}$ be a category consisting of a single object. This encodes
a monoid in the collection of morphisms.
\end{node}
\end{node} % examples

\begin{definition}\label{cat-000O}%
Let $\cat{C}$ be a category. We may form the \define{Opposite} category
of $\cat{C}$, denoted $\cat{C}^{op}$, which consists of the same objects
but a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ in $\cat{C}^{op}$ is precisely the same
as a morphism $f\colon Y\to X$ in $\cat{C}$, and composition of
morphisms in the opposite category $g\circ f$ is precisely the reverse
of composition in the original category $(f\circ g)_{orig}$.

\begin{node}[Duality principle]\label{cat-000P}%
Every construction we can do in a category $\cat{C}$ has a dual
construction in the opposite category $\cat{C}^{op}$ which is usually
prefixed by ``co-''.
\end{node}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{cat-000G}%
Let $\cat{C}$ be a category. We define a \define{Subcategory} of $\cat{C}$
to consist of a category $\cat{D}$ such that $\ob(\cat{D})\subset\ob(\cat{C})$
and for all objects $X,Y\in\ob(\cat{D})$,
$\hom_{\cat{D}}(X,Y)\subset\hom_{\cat{C}}(X,Y)$. The composition of
morphisms in $\cat{D}$ is given by restricting the composition operator
from $\cat{C}$. The identity morphisms in $\cat{D}$ are precisely the
identity morphisms of $\cat{C}$ restricted to the objects of $\cat{D}$.

\begin{definition}\label{cat-000H}%
Let $\cat{D}$ be a subcategory of $\cat{C}$. We say $\cat{D}$ is a
\define{Full} subcategory if for all objects $X,Y\in\ob(\cat{D})$, we
have $\hom_{\cat{D}}(X,Y)=\hom_{\cat{C}}(X,Y)$.
\end{definition}
\end{definition}
\end{node} % category

\begin{node}[Groupoids]\label{cat-000B}%
\begin{definition}\label{cat-000C}%
A \define{Groupoid} is a category whose morphisms are all isomorphisms.
\end{definition}
\begin{node}[Examples]\label{cat-000D}%
\begin{node}\label{cat-000I}%
Let $G$ be a group. Then we can form a groupoid whose set of objects is
just a singleton set, and collection of morphisms is $G$, and
composition operator is the law of composition from the group structure
on $G$. We can reverse this intuition, and assert \emph{all} groups are
``just'' one-object groupoids.
\end{node}

\begin{node}[Fundamental groupoid]\label{cat-000E}%
For any topological space $X$, we may form the fundamental groupoid
$\Pi_{1}(X)$ whose objects are the set of underlying points of $X$ and
morphisms $f\colon A\to B$ are homotopy equivalence classes of paths
from $A$ to $B$.  Composition then concatenates paths.
\end{node}
\end{node}
\end{node}

\begin{node}[Functors]\label{cat-0009}%
When we define a new mathematical gadget, it will be useful to turn our
attention to defining morphisms for our new gadget. We call the
morphisms of categories ``functors''.

\begin{definition}
Let $\cat{C}$, $\cat{D}$ be categories. We define a \define{Functor}
from $\cat{C}$ to $\cat{D}$ to be $F\colon\cat{C}\to\cat{D}$ consisting
of
\begin{enumerate}
\item a mapping of objects $F_{ob}\colon\ob(\cat{C})\to\ob(\cat{D})$;
\item a mapping of morphisms $F_{mor}\colon\hom_{\cat{C}}(X,Y)\to\hom_{\cat{D}}(F_{ob}(X),F_{ob}(Y))$;
\end{enumerate}
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ preserves composition: $F_{mor}(g\circ f)=F_{mor}(g)\circ F_{mor}(f)$ whenever
  $g\circ f$ is defined in $\cat{C}$;
\item $F$ preserves identity morphisms: for each object $X\in\cat{C}$, $F_{mor}(\id_{X})=\id_{F_{ob}(X)}$.
\end{enumerate}
We often suppress the subscripts and just write things like
\[F\left(X\xrightarrow{f}Y\right)\quad=\quad F(X)\xrightarrow{F(f)}F(Y).\]
\end{definition}

\begin{node}[Examples]\label{cat-000J}%
\begin{node}\label{cat-000L}%
Let $\cat{C}$ be a category. We define the \define{Identity functor}
$\Id_{\cat{C}}$ which is just the identity function on objects, and the
identity function on morphisms.
\end{node}
  
\begin{node}[Linear representations of groups]\label{cat-000K}%
Let $\FF$ be a field, let $G$ be a group. We know we can form the
groupoid $\cat{G}$ from $G$ \zref{cat-000I}. Then $\FF$-linear
representations of $G$ are precisely the functions $\cat{G}\to\Vect{\FF}$.
\end{node}

\begin{node}\label{cat-000N}%
Let $\cat{C}$ be a locally-small category, let $X,Y\in\ob(\cat{C})$ be
objects. Then $\hom(X,-)\colon\cat{C}\to\Set$ maps each object
$B\in\cat{C}$ to the set of morphisms $\hom(X,A)$ and each function
$f\colon A\to B$ to $\hom(X,f)\colon\hom(X,A)\to\hom(X,B)$ sending
$g\mapsto f\circ g$ for each $g\in\hom(X,A)$.

We also have $\hom(-,Y)\colon\cat{C}^{op}\to\Set$ be a functor sending each
object $A\in\ob(\cat{C})$ to the set of morphisms $\hom(A,Y)$, and each
morphism $h\colon A\to B$ in $\cat{C}$ to $\hom(h,Y)\colon\hom(B,Y)\to\hom(A,Y)$
sending $g\in\hom(B,Y)$ to $g\circ h\in\hom(A,Y)$.
