We can divide the study of propositional logic into two parts: its
syntax and its semantics. The syntax of propositional logic amounts to
introducing its formal grammar and its informal interpretation, whereas
the semantics amounts to writing down truth tables.

This division into syntax and semantics survives when we study
first-order logic, and (ostensibly) any other formal system.
