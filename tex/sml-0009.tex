\begin{node}[For non-function expressions]\label{sml-0009}%
Let $e$ and $e'$ are two expressions of the same nonfunction type.
We say $e$ and $e'$ are \define{Extensionally Equivalent} and write
$e\exteq e'$ whenever one of the following is true:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluation of $e$ produces the same value as does the evaluation
  of $e'$; or
\item Evaluation of $e$ raises ``the same'' exception as does the evaluation
  of $e'$; or
\item Evaluation of $e$ and $e'$ both loop forever.
\end{enumerate}
By ``raising `the same' exception'', we mean the exceptions are
extensionally equivalent in the following sense:
We call two exceptions ``extensionally equivalent'' if they are of
the same type and their payloads are extensionally equivalent.
