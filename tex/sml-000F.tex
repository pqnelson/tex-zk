\begin{node}[Raising exceptions]\label{sml-000F}%
Let $exn$ be a so-called ``exception packet'' (a ``value'' of some kind
of exception). When an expression $e$ raises an exception, we indicate
this by the judgement ``$e\Reduces{}\Raise{exn}$''. If we know this is done
in $k\in\NN$ steps, then we may write ``$e\Reduces{k}\Raise{exn}$''.

If, in the process of evaluating some expression $e[e']$ which has $e'$
as a subexpression, we have $e'\Reduces{}\Raise{exn}$, then
the exception propagates out $e[e']\Reduces{}\Raise{exn}$.
