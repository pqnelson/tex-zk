\begin{definition}\label{fol-0007}%
Let $M$ be an interpretation with domain $D$. A \define{Valuation} in
first-order logic is a mapping from the set of variables to $D$.
This is consistent with our usage of the term in propositional logic
\zref{prop-0004} which maps our set of propositional variables to the
set of truth values.
