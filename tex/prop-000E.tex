\begin{node}[Adequate sets of connectives]\label{prop-000E}%
Every proposition is logically equivalent to a proposition involving the
connectives $\neg$, $\land$, $\lor$. That is to say, the set of
connectives $\{\neg,\land,\lor\}$ is adequate for propositional logic
and the others may be expressed in terms of them.

Furthermore, the sets $\{\neg,\land\}$, $\{\neg,\lor\}$, and $\{\neg,\implies\}$
are adequate for propositional logic (in the sense that any proposition
is logically equivalent to one involving only these connectives). This
is because $A\land B$ is logically equivalent to $\neg(\neg A\lor\neg B)$,
$A\implies B$ is logically equivalent to $(\neg A)\lor B$, and $A\iff B$
is logically equivalent to $(A\implies B)\land(B\implies A)$.
