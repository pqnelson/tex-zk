\chapter{Differential and Integral Calculus}

\begin{node}\label{calculus-0000}%
There is a ``purely symbolic'' (I'd say ``purely formal'', but this
overloads the word ``formal'' too much) way to do calculus. This is
basically what we learn as first-year undergraduates. It's fun and
carefree, but leads to paradoxes if taken seriously.
