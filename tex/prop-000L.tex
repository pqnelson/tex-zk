\begin{definition}\label{prop-000L}%
We call a proposition $A$ a \define{Tautology} (or \textit{Logically Valid})
if it evaluates to $\verum$ under every valuation $\rho(A)=\verum$.
That is to say, its truth-table value is ``true'' for \emph{all} rows.

``Validity'' is the term used in first-order logic, but Wittgenstein's
\textit{Tractatus} popularized the term ``Tautology''.
