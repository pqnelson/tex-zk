This is a toy model of a pseudo-Zettelkasten using simple LaTeX macros
and ISO-2145 numbering of nodes.

In some sense, it is a variant of Jonathan Sterling's
[dieudonne](https://github.com/jonsterling/latex-dieudonne/) package,
but the numbering for nodes are not in parentheses. (Instead, they're
bold.)

There is a simple example using lorem ipsum and other random text, just
run `pdflatex zk` to produce the PDF output.
